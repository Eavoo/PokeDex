# PokeDex
A Live updating Pokedex project based on PokeAPI



This was made as a project with my classmates in CIT, I added a little more than them, and wanted to publish it to the Internet.


The <span style="color:blue">Basic</span> Folder is the original project, The <span style="color:blue">Full</span> Folder is my finished product using more information from the API.
